## Recommendations

Fonts in `Recursive_Desktop` and `Recursive_Code` are made so that it is possible to install all of these without experiencing conflicts in font menus. However, you may want to pick-and-choose which font files you wish to install, based on your needs.

**General Desktop use (Word, PowerPoint, Keynote, InDesign, Illustrator, PhotoShop, Figma, etc)**

- On Windows, install `Recursive_Desktop/recursive-statics.ttc` (This is a collection of all 64 static instances in TTF format)
- On Mac, install `Recursive_Desktop/recursive-statics.otc` (This is a collection of all 64 static instances in OTF format)

**Desktop web design (Sketch) & experimental use in Adobe apps**

- Install `Recursive_Desktop/Recursive_VF_1.042.ttf`
- It may also be beneficial to install static fonts, as support of variable fonts is still growing

**Code (code editors such as VS Code, Atom, Sublime, etc etc)**

- Install fonts in `Recursive_Code` (These are specifically simplified families for use in code editors. See README in that directory for further advice)

**Web**

- Use the woff2 font files in `Recursive_Web`. This includes a few useful subsets for variable fonts, along with some starter `@font-face` CSS for the `woff2_variable_subsets`. 
- If you only need a style or two on a site, it may be practical to just use static instances, but you may want to figure out subsetting with `pyftsubset` to make those even smaller.
